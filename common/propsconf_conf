# ========================== Instructions =========================
# =================================================================
# Set the above variables to the desired prop/configuration values.
#
# CONFFINGERPRINT should be set to the fingerprint of a ROM that passes
# the ctsProfile check. See the prints.sh file for usable prints,
# or the documentation for information on how to find one.
#
# CONFPROPFILES should be set to "true" if you want to mask the file
# values in build.prop and default.prop. For better root hiding.
#
# The MagiskHide prop variables can be set as follows:
# CONFDEBUGGABLE - 0 or 1 (set to "0" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "1")
# CONFSECURE - 0 or 1 (set to "1" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "0")
# CONFTYPE - user or userdebug (set to "user" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "userdebug")
# CONFTAGS - release-keys or test-keys (set to "release-keys" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "test-keys")
# CONFSELINUX - 0 or 1 (set to "0" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "1")
#
# CONFPROPS should contain any custom props and the value you want the module to set.
# Any props you've previously edited in build.prop, and more, can be set like this.
# Add them to the CONFPROPS variable according to the following example:
# CONFPROPS="
# ro.sf.lcd_density=320
# ro.config.media_vol_steps=30
# net.tethering.noprovisioning=true
# "
# With PROPOPTION you can decide if the current custom prop list should
# be replaced, added to or preserved. Add the corresponding words "replace",
# "add", or "preserve". The default option is to replace the list.
# This option supersedes the preserve option described below, but only
# for the CONFPROPS variable.
#
# CONFDELPROPS is a list of props you want to remove from your system.
# Be very careful when using this option, removing the wrong props might
# cause issues.
# Add the props you want to remove to the CONFDELPROPS variable according to
# the following example:
# CONFDELPROPS="
# ro.sf.lcd_density
# ro.config.media_vol_steps
# net.tethering.noprovisioning
# "
# With DELPROPOPTION you can decide if the current custom prop list should
# be replaced, added to or preserved. Add the corresponding words "replace",
# "add", or "preserve". The default option is to replace the list.
# This option supersedes the preserve option described below, but only
# for the CONFDELPROPS variable.
#
# CONFLATE is by default set to "true". This loads the boot script during the
# late_start service mode. If the setting is changed to "false", the boot script
# will instead be loaded earlier during boot, in the post-fs-data mode. This is
# useful if the module can't set the props correctly. Known to happen on some
# LineageOS 15.1 ROMs, and possibly others.
#
# CONFCOLOUR and CONFWEB are the options for colour and automatic fingerprints
# list update. See the module documentation for more details.
#
# If any variables are left unset, that particular prop/configuration
# will be cleared and the device/MagiskHide default values will be used.
# If you want to keep any current module settings, add "preserve" to the variable.
# Example:
# CONFFINGERPRINT=preserve
#
# When placed in /cache or the root of your internal storage, the module will load these
# values during boot and the configuration file will be deleted. Keep a backup of the
# file if you want to reuse it at a later time (clean ROM flash, etc).
